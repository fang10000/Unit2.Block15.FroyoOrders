Build your website according to this user story:

A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee. When they view the browser console, they observe a table listing how many of each flavor they have ordered.

Notes: <br>
* The code is able to identify the unique list of flavors from customer's order and generate a table <br>
| (index)     | Value   |
| ----------- | ------- |
| banana      | 2       |
| chocolate   | 2       |
| strawberry  | 1       |

* Additional thinking: this is not robust if the customer misspelled a flavor ("banana,bannaa,strawberry") or the customer added space after ","
