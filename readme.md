# Unit2.Froyo

Build your website according to this user story:

A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee. When they view the browser console, they observe a table listing how many of each flavor they have ordered. In this case, they will be able to observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee, and one strawberry froyo.

## Submission

The github repository is https://github.com/fang10000/Unit2.Froyo <br>

Notes: <br>
The code is able to identify the unique list of flavors from customer's order and generate a table <br>
| (index)     | Value   |
| :----------:| ------- |
| banana      | 2       |
| chocolate   | 2       |
| strawberry  | 1       |

## UPDATED ON NOV 9 
Graded 8.5/10 for the below: 
// An object is used to keep count of how many orders there are of each flavor. -0.5/1.0
// The program correctly counts the number of each flavor in the user's input. -0.5/1.0
// The logic for counting the frequencies of elements in an array is organized into a function that returns an object. -0.5/1.0

## Student Notes on Nov 9
* I did **not** use a function, which is update in the v2.
* *Reduce* is a very powerful function. I didn't need to do the three step (finding unique value -> set quantity to 0 -> count). This can all be achieved with a one-liner.
